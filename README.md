When a city is searched for, the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history

The application includes the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

For future weather, the user will see a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
